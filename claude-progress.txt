# Progress Summary - Initializer Agent

## Accomplishments
1. **Feature List Creation**:
   - Generated `feature_list.json` with 215 detailed feature/test cases covering all specs.
   - Categories include: Functional, Style
   - Modules covered: TrianglePerimeter, CircleArea, TreePlanting, CompositeArea, EquationSolver, WordProblems, DecimalOperations, Global UI.

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Created `init.sh` for easy environment initialization.
   - Configured `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
   - Setup `src/index.css` with Tailwind directives.
   - Installed dependencies: `tailwindcss@3.4.17`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`, `framer-motion`.

3. **Project Restructuring**:
   - Refactored flat file structure to standard `src/` based structure.
   - Moved components, pages, utils to `src/`.
   - Updated `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, and `index.html` to reflect new structure.
   - Verified build with `npm run build` (Successful).

4. **Git Initialization**:
   - Initialized git repo (was already initialized, but added files).
   - Committed `feature_list.json`, specs, and structural changes.

## Next Steps for Coder Agent
- **Priority**: Start implementing "Global UI & Shared Components" (features 11-40).
- **First Task**: Create `Layout.tsx` and Navigation Sidebar to establish the shell of the application.
- **Then**: Implement basic routing structure for all new modules based on `feature_list.json`.

## Notes
- Tailwind CSS is configured with v3.4.17.
- `app_spec.txt` is the source of truth.
- `feature_list.json` is the tracking mechanism. DO NOT REMOVE ITEMS, only mark `passes: true`.

## Accomplishments
1. **Global Layout & Navigation**:
   - Implemented `Sidebar.tsx` with `lucide-react` icons.
   - Updated `Layout.tsx` to use the persistent sidebar design.
   - Configured `App.tsx` with routes for all 7 modules (including 5 new placeholder modules).
   - Added placeholder pages for: TreePlanting, CompositeArea, EquationSolver, WordProblems, DecimalOperations.

2. **Verification**:
   - Added `.vscode/launch.json` for Edge debugging.
   - Verified navigation and layout using browser automation.
   - Confirmed Sidebar links correctly navigate to routes and display placeholder content.

3. **Status Updates**:
   - Marked "Setup Project Structure", "Install React Router", "Create Global Layout Component", and "Design Navigation Sidebar" as `passes: true` in `feature_list.json`.

## Next Steps
- Implement the "Triangle Perimeter" module (Highest priority feature showing "passes": false).
- Improve "Home" page design if needed.
- Begin implementing core visualization components for the new modules.
