# Progress Summary - Coder Agent (Session 4)

## Accomplishments
1. **Circle Area Module Bug Fix**:
   - Addressed user feedback regarding "large gap between top and bottom sectors" in Steps 4 & 5.
   - Diagnosed that the vertical offset was insufficient (100px vs 140px required for full overlap).
   - Updated `CircleArea.tsx` logic to use `RADIUS / 2` (70px) as the vertical offset, ensuring precise interlocking.
   - Updated SVG visualization braces to correctly label the height as `r` (matching the new physical height).

2. **Verification**:
   - Used browser automation to verify the fix.
   - Confirmed visually that the sectors now fit tightly with no vertical gap.
   - Verified that the "Rectangle" formation looks correct.

3. **Status Updates**:
   - Updated `feature_list.json`: Marked "Fix Gap Bug", "Rectangular Formation", "Unfolding Animation Steps", "Area Formula Derivation UI", etc. as `passes: true`.

## Next Steps
- Implement **Tree Planting (植树问题)** module.
- Continue with Phase 2 of `implementation_plan`.
